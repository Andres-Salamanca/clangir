### `-cir-drop-ast`: Remove clang AST nodes attached to CIR operations
Some CIR operations have references back to Clang AST, this is
necessary to perform lots of useful checks without having to
duplicate all rich AST information in CIR. As we move down in the
pipeline (e.g. generating LLVM or other MLIR dialects), the need
for such nodes diminish and AST information can be dropped.

Right now this is enabled by default in Clang prior to dialect
codegen from CIR, but not before lifetime check, where AST is
required to be present.
### `-cir-lifetime-check`: Check lifetime safety and generate diagnostics
This pass relies on a lifetime analysis pass and uses the diagnostics
mechanism to report to the user. It does not change any code.

A default ctor is specified but is solely in order to make
tablegen happy, since this pass requires the presence of an ASTContext,
one can set that up using `mlir::createLifetimeCheckPass(clang::ASTContext &)`
instead.

#### Options
```
-history       : List of history styles to emit as part of diagnostics. Supported styles: {all|null|invalid}
-remarks       : List of remark styles to enable as part of diagnostics. Supported styles: {all|pset}
-history_limit : Max amount of diagnostics to emit on pointer history
```
### `-cir-merge-cleanups`: Remove unnecessary branches to cleanup blocks
Canonicalize pass is too aggressive for CIR when the pipeline is
used for C/C++ analysis. This pass runs some rewrites for scopes,
merging some blocks and eliminating unnecessary control-flow.
