### `-cir-drop-ast`

_Remove clang AST nodes attached to CIR operations_

Some CIR operations have references back to Clang AST, this is
necessary to perform lots of useful checks without having to
duplicate all rich AST information in CIR. As we move down in the
pipeline (e.g. generating LLVM or other MLIR dialects), the need
for such nodes diminish and AST information can be dropped.

Right now this is enabled by default in Clang prior to dialect
codegen from CIR, but not before lifetime check, where AST is
required to be present.
### `-cir-idiom-recognizer`

_Raise calls to C/C++ libraries to CIR operations_

This pass recognize idiomatic C++ usage and incorporate C++ standard
containers, library functions calls, and types into CIR operation,
attributes and types.

Detections done by this pass can be inspected by users by using
remarks. Currently supported are `all` and `found-calls`.

#### Options
```
-remarks : Diagnostic remarks to enable Supported styles: {all|found-calls}
```
### `-cir-lib-opt`

_Optimize C/C++ library calls_

By using higher level information from `cir-idiom-recognize`, this pass
apply transformations to CIR based on specific C/C++ library semantics.

Transformations done by this pass can be inspected by users by using
remarks. Currently supported are `all` and `transforms`.

#### Options
```
-remarks : Diagnostic remarks to enable Supported styles: {all|transforms}
```
### `-cir-lifetime-check`

_Check lifetime safety and generate diagnostics_

This pass relies on a lifetime analysis pass and uses the diagnostics
mechanism to report to the user. It does not change any code.

A default ctor is specified but is solely in order to make
tablegen happy, since this pass requires the presence of an ASTContext,
one can set that up using `mlir::createLifetimeCheckPass(clang::ASTContext &)`
instead.

#### Options
```
-history       : List of history styles to emit as part of diagnostics. Supported styles: {all|null|invalid}
-remarks       : List of remark styles to enable as part of diagnostics. Supported styles: {all|pset}
-history_limit : Max amount of diagnostics to emit on pointer history
```
### `-cir-lowering-prepare`

_Preparation work before lowering to LLVM dialect_

This pass does preparation work for LLVM lowering. For example, it may
expand the global variable initialziation in a more ABI-friendly form.
### `-cir-merge-cleanups`

_Remove unnecessary branches to cleanup blocks_

Canonicalize pass is too aggressive for CIR when the pipeline is
used for C/C++ analysis. This pass runs some rewrites for scopes,
merging some blocks and eliminating unnecessary control-flow.
