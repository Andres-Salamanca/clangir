# Clang IR (CIR)

Clang IR (CIR) is a new IR for Clang. The [LLVM's discourse RFC](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-an-mlir-based-clang-ir-cir/63319) goes in depth about
the project motivation, status and design choices.

This project is part of the LLVM incubator, the source of truth for CIR is found at
[https://github.com/llvm/clangir](https://github.com/llvm/clangir).

The [main](https://github.com/facebookincubator/clangir/tree/main) branch
contains a stack of commits, occasionally rebased on top of LLVM upstream,
tracked in
[latest-upstream-llvm](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/tree/latest-upstream-llvm)
branch.
